## TLDR

There are two groups of three and four teams, respectively. Each team in each group plays all the other teams once in games of __Mario Kart__ and __Fussball__.

The best teams from each group go into a knock-out round that will decide who will become _the Champions of the Resolve Christmas Games 2023_ - thus sementing their names on the glourios Resolve Games Trophy for eternity!


## Practicalities

### Playing times

The teams are responsible for finding suitable times for their own matches. Make sure you have played all of your matches by Wednesday, Dec 13th!

### Results

After a match, the winning team is responsible for entering the match score. This is done under the _Matches_ tab.

### Other
- If you don't play a game, don't expect to get any points! If it is obviously the other team that don't have their prioritizations straight, you _may_ get lucky.
- Note that you can change your team name in the _Teams_ tab.

## Rules

### General
- No foul play!
- Mind games and friendly banter is fine (and encouraged??).

### Mario Kart

- The teams playing a match agree on (or randomly select) a Grand Prix and play it out.
- The score of a team is the sum of the points of the two players on the team (this is what you input when logging the result!). The team with the highest score wins.
- Note that this means that you can draw in Mario Kart!

### Fuzzball

- We play doubles, meaning that one player controls the goalkeeper and the defence; the other player controls the midfielders and the attack. You are free to swap positions at any time, though!
- No spinning! Spinning is defined as turning any of the rods more than 360 degrees without touching the ball.
- Balls are to be dropped neutrally - no adding spin to the ball on the drop!
- First team to 10 points wins!
- Other than this, if there are disagremeents, we (obviously) follow the [official rules](https://www.foosballsoccer.com/official-foosball-rules.html).
